# Bank.Ease ATM Login (Java Swing)

This project is a Java Swing-based GUI application that simulates a login interface for an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) as part of a banking system. The graphical interface is implemented using Java Swing and AWT libraries.

## Features

- Card Number and PIN Input fields for authentication
- Sign In, Clear, and Sign Up buttons with event handling
- Modern and intuitive interface using Java Swing components
- Easy to understand and customize for learning purposes

## Technologies Used

- Java 8+
- Swing (`javax.swing.*`)
- AWT (`java.awt.*`)

## How It Works

- The main window allows users to input their card number and PIN.
- Clicking **Sign In** would trigger future authentication logic.
- **Clear** button resets both input fields for a new entry.
- **Sign Up** is for new user registration (future implementation).
